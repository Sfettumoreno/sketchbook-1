# Sketchbook

I created this sketchbook to reduce the amount of time it takes to play around with new ideas. It contains a starter project, `_blank`, and a few examples.

## How to use it

Duplicate the `_blank` folder and give it a new name. Then get in there and start hacking!

## What's included

The `_blank` project contains a few files to get you started:

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>filename</th>
		<th>description</th>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>index.html</td>
			<td>An example HTML file. It uses the HTML5 `html` [doctype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Introduction_to_HTML5) and includes a few example CSS and JavaScript files.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>style/main.css</td>
			<td>An example CSS file. It only contains one style to demonstrate proper syntax.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>scripts/main.js</td>
			<td>An example JavaScript file. It demonstrates create a click handler in [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and how to log to the console.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>scripts/vendor/jquery.js</td>
			<td>The [jQuery](http://jquery.com) library. jQuery is extremely popular and a great stepping stone when you're first learning JavaScript.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>scripts/vendor/html5.js</td>
			<td>The [HTML5 shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) adds support for HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
