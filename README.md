# Sketchbook

I created this sketchbook to reduce the amount of time it takes to play around with new ideas. It contains a starter project, `_blank`, and a few examples.

## How to use it

Duplicate the `_blank` project and give it a new name. Then get in there and start hacking!

## What's included

The `_blank` project contains a few files to get you started:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>filename</tr>
		<tr>description</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>index.html</td>
			<td>An example HTML file. It uses the HTML5 `html` doctype and includes a few example CSS and JavaScript files.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
